      <h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
      <p>Today is for you, the most wonderful and fabulous and loving person in my life, shining brightly and throwing light on everything around me, which can't be put into words, and I'm grateful every single day for you. May this day become as happy for you as you make it for me, full of love, laughter, and all the sweet moments that you deserve. You are not just my girlfriend; you are actually my best friend, my inspiration, and my happiness all bunched up into one. Mahal na mahal kita, Adi. Can't wait to spend a lot more birthdays and countless other special moments with you. Cheers to you and all the amazing things to come. Cheers to another year of love and adventure together.</p>
